#Tutorials used

As an example to follow I've used pyroelectro's tutorial:
[http://www.pyroelectro.com/projects/8x8x8_led_cube/](http://www.pyroelectro.com/projects/8x8x8_led_cube/)
That's probably the most detailed out there.
Also there is a considerable improvement to the cube mesh building
I have found after my mesh was soldered. I will include the link later
when I will find it once again.
